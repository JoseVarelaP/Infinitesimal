# About PIU Infinitesimal
This theme aims to essentially be a spiritual successor to Pump It Up Infinity, a notoriously uncommon StepMania based spin-off developed by Team Infinity and licensed by Andamiro. Infinitesimal aims to replicate the look and feel of Infinity without bringing yet another crappy Infinity port made with poorly ripped assets into existence. The goal is for all of Infinitesimal's graphics to be completely original, which so far is true for everything except the life bar and maybe a font or two, as well as for the game to run as smoothly as possible with StepMania 5.3.

# Requirements
* StepMania 5.3 Outfox (May not be backwards compatible, untested)
* Patience (This theme is far from done!)
