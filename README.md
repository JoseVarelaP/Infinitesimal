# About PIU Infinitesimal
This theme aims to essentially be a spiritual successor to Pump It Up Infinity, a notoriously uncommon StepMania based spin-off developed by Team Infinity and licensed by Andamiro. Infinitesimal aims to replicate the look and feel of Infinity without bringing yet another crappy Infinity port made with poorly ripped assets into existence. The goal is for all of Infinitesimal's graphics to be completely original, which so far is true for everything except the life bar and maybe a font or two, as well as for the game to run as smoothly as possible with StepMania 5.3.

# Notes on profile images
Avatars should be stored in the game's /Appearance/Avatars directory.
We don't quite have a way to select profile icons in-theme yet, so for the time being:
1. Navigate to your profile (in portable mode this would be /StepMania 5.3 Outfox/Save/LocalProfiles/00000000)
2. Open up OutFoxPrefs.ini and find the `AvatarImage` line
3. Type in the path to the avatar you want (starting in the game's root folder), for example `AvatarImage=/Appearance/Avatars/dj505.png`
The avatar you selected will now show up in-game!

# Requirements
* StepMania 5.3 Outfox (Will not work properly with 5.1 and below)
* Patience (This theme is far from done!)
